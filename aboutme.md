We are Codebrick@SF - a group of young professionals made of mostly architects and designers. We love thinking, discussing and sharing, quality and proactive thoughts revolving the evolution of design, with a special focus on integration of technologies into what we do:

- I draw a great picture
- I'm extremely loyal to open-minded souls
- I look forward to hearing about funny but useful ideas

What else do you need?

### who are we?

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [our map](http://codebrick.us/CodeBrickMap) and it will answer **all** your questions.
