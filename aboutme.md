码砖大队（Team Code Brick)是当代建筑、设计、工程师组成的社 群，旨在开放地探讨新建筑及设计 --- 在时代变迁及科技变革中的角色和新 兴的应用。码砖大队基于内部成员的特长做不定期线上及线下分享活动，同 时也根据硅谷等地的科技行业新兴变革邀请举办业内外的交流探讨。不拘的 职业视野，独立的当代探索，开放的设计生态圈是码砖大队的本色。码砖大 队源起于2015年美国加州湾区华人建筑及设计师的阳台聚会，逐渐根据成 员对当代社会变革浪潮中的共同兴趣聚集起的松散实践团体。
Team Code Brick(TCB) is a group of architects, designers and engineers who are assembled under the era of social progress and innovation of technology, to celebrate and explore the role of new architecture and design application in trend. Events are hosted to share, spread and even pitch ideas based on internal interest and emerging technology innovation initiated at areas such as silicon valley. Untamed perspective, independent exploration and open design community are our core values. TCB originated from a balcony event with ethnic Chinese archi- tects and designers in California Bay Area, 2015. And it has evolved into a practice community with shared interests in contemporary society.


小编脚注： 
We are Codebrick@SF - a group of young professionals made of mostly architects and designers. We love thinking, discussing and sharing, quality and proactive thoughts revolving the evolution of design, with a special focus on integration of technologies into what we do:

- I draw a great picture
- I'm extremely loyal to open-minded souls
- I look forward to hearing about funny but useful ideas

What else do you need?
